My Image Manipulation Tools for Digital Humanities
===================================================

This is the collection of small utilities for image processing
I implemented for digital humanities research.

Note that this is entirely a hack (though, cleaned for internal batch
processing) and I will never support these tools.


Tools in the Collection
------------------------

Note that some tools are experimental and will be changed or removed
in the future.

*	binarize  
	Image binarization (constant threshold or adaptive)
*	binarize-sauvola  
	Image binarization based on Sauvola's algorithm
*	isolate-bg  
	Isolate image background using Sauvola's algorithm
*	mask-op  
	General-purpose mask manipulation tool
